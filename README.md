# E85 Engines
This is a little mod that introduces E85, E100, and Natural Gas(LNG) fuel to the game. If you like running your engines on moonshine this is the perfect
mod for you. Now all gasoline engines should be able to burn E85, E100 or Natural GAS, with reduced fuel economy since these fuels have reduced energy
density than gasoline. If you're running low on gasoline or don't know how to make diesel yet, these alternatives are great renewable energy source for 
your deathmobile.

**Present Content:**
1. E85 fuel made from Gasoline+ethanol. E100 is basically 100% ethanol.
2. A better use for the tons of yeast you will generate from fermenting stuff.  LIQUID FERTILIZER USING YEAST!!!!
3. Natural Gas derived from mutant gas sacs. Its mainly Methane or Insect Farts....whatever is in their gas sacs, it burns and it burns well.
IT IS CURRENTLY A LIQUID. I couldn't find a way to make recipes to be able to fill a pressurised tank like propane tank after crafting the Natural Gas, because of my limited
knowledge of modding the game. :(
4. Fertilizers made from chitin powder. 
5. Gasoline Engines now run on Gasoline, E85, E100, and LNG.

**Instalation**
Simple drag and drop to mods folder.

**Compitability**
Should be fine to use with any mod. 
Exept maybe ones that change combustion.json file in the vehicleparts folder in main game since this mod overwrites that file at the moment.



//// Future Plans
1. Make production of fuel grade ethanol(E100)(non consumable) possible using a structure(that will work similar to fermenting vat, but use electricity/?charcoal?) that will allow you to put
vodka_wort, fruit wine must etc. and get fuel grade ethanol after the proccess is complete. Making the whole process less of a chore for the player.
2. Make it possible to convert your gasoline engine to run ethanol fuel E100/E85 or LNG/Propane, !BUT! at the cost of not being able to run pure gasoline anymore. At the moment gasoline engines will run on all three new fuel
without the need for modification, which is kind of not the case irl.
3. Make it possible to make Ethanol Fuel using the Basecamp missions.
4. Make E85 available in some Gas Stations, but rare.
5. Add more IRL uses of yeast to the game. Because you will produce tooo damn much of it going the moonshine burning route.
8. More uses for Natural Gas and Propane.
