# E85 Engines v0.1
This is a little mod that introduces E85 fuel to the game. If you like running your engines on moonshine this is the perfect
mod for you. Now all gasoline engines should be able to burn E85 with reduced fuel economy since this fuel has reduced energy
density than gasoline by about 50%. Gasoline is at 34400kj while this mix is at 18390KJ. I used alcohol and gasoline material
energy values to calculate it. If you're running low on gasoline or don't know how to make diesel yet, this recipe is found in 
Advanced Chemistry book that is more common.

This fuel is best used with small engines (25cc and 50cc) since their minimal fuel consumption is proportionally bigger than the 
energy they produce, because of rounding up numbers lesser than 1 in fuel consumption calculations in the game. Making E85 
perfect for running small makeshift generators. 

Examples of fuel consumption on a makeshift generator vehicle:

50cc+car alt+moto alt	- 1.1L/hour E85///0.6L/hour Gasoline
25cc+car alt+moto alt   -1.1L/hour E85////0.6L/hour Gasoline
600cc+car alt+moto alt  -1.6L/hour E85///0.9L hour Gasoline


50cc+car+moto+truck alt  -2.2L/hour E85///1.2/hour Gasoline
600cc+car+moto+truck alt -3.2L/hour E85///1.7/hour Gasoline


15600KJ*0.85+34400KJ*0.15= 18390 KJ 
Yes it is a bit low, but you are not making fuel refienry quality ethanol, so yours is not as pure and has lots of water content.
Careful to not blow your gaskets or damage your injectiors...or worse seize up the engine! - Just joking nothing gonna happen.

As you can see the 50cc is much much smaller and weaker engine, but consumes only about 40%-50% less than a 600cc that has x5 more horsepower.
But since we don't plan on driving the generator around all the extra horsepower is pointless so 50cc is really all we need for 3xalternator build,
but at what cost?  :
A 50cc idles at 69% fuel/hour compared to a 600cc on E85.
A 50cc idles at 71% fuel/hour compared to a 600cc on Gasoline.


As you can see 25cc/50cc are really not that great for fuel economy since fuel consumption can never be less than 1 so using a fuel
with less energy density results in about the same fuel efficiency compared to a 600cc found on most motorcycles in tent camps etc.



Present Content:
1. E85 fuel made from Gasoline+ethanol. E100 is basically 100% ethanol.
2. A better use for the metric sh*tton of yeast you will generate from fermenting stuff.  LIQUID FERTILIZER USING YEAST!!!!
3. Natural Gas derived from mutant gas sacs. Its mainly Methane or Insect Farts....whatever is in their gas sacs, it burns and it burns well.
IT IS CURRENTLY A LIQUID. I couldn't find a way to make recipes to be able to fill a pressurised tank like propane tank after crafting the Natural Gas, because of my limited
knowledge of modding the game. :(
4. Fertilizers made from chitin powder. 
5. Gasoline Engines now run on Gasoline, E85, E100, and LNG. 



//// Future Plans
1. Make production of fuel grade ethanol(E100)(non consumable) possible using a structure(that will work similar to fermenting vat, but use electricity/?charcoal?) that will allow you to put
vodka_wort, fruit wine must etc. and get fuel grade ethanol after the proccess is complete. Making the whole process less of a chore for the player.
2. Make it possible to convert your gasoline engine to run ethanol fuel E100/E85 or LNG/Propane, !BUT! at the cost of not being able to run pure gasoline anymore. At the moment gasoline engines will run on all three new fuel
without the need for modification, which is kind of not the case irl.
3. Make it possible to make Ethanol Fuel using the Basecamp missions.
4. Make E85 available in some Gas Stations, but rare.
5. Add more IRL uses of yeast to the game. Because you will produce tooo damn much of it going the moonshine burning route.
8. More uses for Natural Gas and Propane.
